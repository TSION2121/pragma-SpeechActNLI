    "Build an integrated pragmatic analyzer in a Colab notebook. This involves: adding a project statement; setting up the environment by installing and importing necessary libraries (`transformers`, `datasets`, `torch`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `safetensors`); implementing a speech act classifier using a fine-tuned `DistilBertForSequenceClassification` model, including loading dummy data (due to issues with the Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus), data preparation, training, evaluation, and failure analysis with categorization and visualization; implementing a Natural Language Inference (NLI) component using a pre-trained `roberta-large-mnli` model with a defined knowledge base, including evaluation with manually created pairs, and failure analysis with categorization and visualization; defining and demonstrating an integrated `pragmatic_analyzer` function that combines speech act classification and conditional NLI verification for statements; and concluding with a summary of findings, challenges, and future work."

    "### Overview\n",
    "This section details the critical steps taken to prepare our dummy speech act data for model training. Given the complexities of natural language, raw text data and categorical labels must be transformed into a numerical format that machine learning models can process effectively. The main steps involve standardizing dialogue act labels, encoding these labels numerically, and tokenizing the textual utterances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preparation Steps\n",
    "1.  **Dialogue Act Tag Mapping**: The original `dialogue_act` labels from our dummy dataset are diverse. To simplify the classification task and align with common pragmatic categories, these labels are mapped to a reduced set of target classes: 'statement', 'question', and 'directive'. Any labels not fitting these categories will be assigned to an 'other' category for comprehensive coverage.\n",
    "2.  **Numerical Label Encoding**: Machine learning models require numerical input. Therefore, each of the simplified target classes ('statement', 'question', 'directive', 'other') will be assigned a unique integer ID. This creates a direct numerical representation for the classification targets.\n",
    "3.  **Utterance Tokenization**: Textual utterances need to be converted into numerical sequences that a pre-trained language model can understand. We will use `DistilBertTokenizerFast` for this purpose. This involves:\n",
    "    *   **Splitting text into tokens**: Breaking down sentences into sub-word units.\n",
    "    *   **Converting tokens to numerical IDs**: Mapping each token to its corresponding ID in the tokenizer's vocabulary.\n",
    "    *   **Adding special tokens**: Incorporating tokens like `[CLS]` (for classification) and `[SEP]` (to separate sentences).\n",
    "    *   **Padding and Truncation**: Ensuring all input sequences have a uniform length, padding shorter sequences and truncating longer ones to a predefined maximum length.\n",
    "4.  **Dataset Creation**: The processed data, including tokenized input IDs, attention masks, and numerical labels, will be organized into `torch.utils.data.Dataset` objects. These objects facilitate easy loading and batching of data during the training and evaluation phases, making them compatible with PyTorch's data loaders."

Fine-tuning adapts a model that has already learned general language representations on a massive dataset to a specific downstream task with a smaller, task-specific dataset. This process leverages the pre-trained knowledge, requiring less data and computational resources than training a model from scratch.\n",

    "### Key Components:\n",
    "1.  **`DistilBertForSequenceClassification`**: This is a specific variant of the DistilBERT model designed for sequence classification tasks. It takes an input sequence and outputs a probability distribution over the defined target classes (in our case, 'statement', 'question', 'directive').\n",
    "2.  **`TrainingArguments`**: This class from the `transformers` library defines all the parameters necessary for training, such as the number of epochs, batch size, logging directories, and optimization settings. It centralizes hyperparameter management.\n",
    "3.  **`Trainer`**: The `Trainer` class provides a high-level API for training PyTorch models with 🤗 Transformers. It abstracts away the training loop, handling details like optimization, scheduling, evaluation, and logging, making the fine-tuning process straightforward."

    "## Natural Language Inference (NLI) - Model Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Natural Language Inference (NLI), also known as Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE), is the task of determining whether a 'hypothesis' (a statement) is true (entailment), false (contradiction), or undetermined (neutral) given a 'premise' (a fact or context). In this project, the NLI component serves as a verification mechanism for statements classified by the speech act classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Choice: `roberta-large-mnli`\n",
    "We will use the `roberta-large-mnli` model from the Hugging Face `transformers` library. This model is a RoBERTa-large model that has been fine-tuned on the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI) corpus, making it highly effective for NLI tasks. It is designed to classify the relationship between two sentences (premise and hypothesis) into one of three categories: 'ENTAILMENT', 'CONTRADICTION', or 'NEUTRAL'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Knowledge Base for NLI Verification\n",
    "For the purpose of demonstrating the NLI component, we will define a small, in-memory `knowledge_base` consisting of 3-5 simple, declarative facts. This knowledge base will act as our set of 'premises' against which new statements (our 'hypotheses') will be verified. In a real-world application, this knowledge base could be a much larger, dynamic repository of structured or unstructured information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `nli_check` Function\n",
    "To integrate NLI into our pragmatic analyzer, we will implement an `nli_check` function. This function will take a statement (hypothesis) and a fact from our `knowledge_base` (premise) as input. It will then leverage the `roberta-large-mnli` model to predict the logical relationship between the two, returning the NLI label."

    "## Natural Language Inference (NLI) - Failure Analysis and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Even highly performant NLI models can exhibit errors, especially when dealing with nuanced language, world knowledge gaps, or complex logical structures. A thorough failure analysis is crucial to understand the limitations of the `roberta-large-mnli` model in our specific application and to identify areas for potential improvement or cautious interpretation of results. Visualization of these failures can provide quick, actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "1.  **Identify Inaccuracies**: Pinpoint specific instances where the NLI model fails to correctly identify the relationship between a statement and a fact (e.g., predicting 'NEUTRAL' instead of 'ENTAILMENT', or 'CONTRADICTION' instead of 'NEUTRAL').\n",
    "2.  **Categorize Error Types**: Group similar misclassifications to discern patterns. Common NLI error categories might include:\n",
    "    *   **Lexical Overlap Issues**: Model relies too heavily on shared words rather than meaning.\n",
    "    *   **World Knowledge Gaps**: Model lacks external information to correctly infer relationships.\n",
    "    *   **Negation/Antonym Errors**: Fails to correctly interpret negative statements or antonyms.\n",
    "    *   **Logical Reasoning Flaws**: Struggles with more complex inferential steps.\n",
    "    *   **Ambiguity**: Input statements or facts are inherently ambiguous, leading to varied interpretations.\n",
    "3.  **Inform Improvements**: The insights gained from failure analysis can guide strategies for improving the NLI component, such as refining the knowledge base, considering different NLI models, or adding pre-processing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "We will manually review the predictions from the `nli_check` function against our expected outcomes for the `example_statements` and `knowledge_base`. For each identified failure, we will record the statement, the fact, the predicted NLI label, and the *expected* NLI label, categorizing the type of error. Finally, we will visualize the distribution of these failure categories using a bar chart to highlight prevalent issues."

    "## Integrated Pragmatic Analyzer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This section culminates the previous developments by integrating the Speech Act Classifier and the Natural Language Inference (NLI) component into a single, cohesive `pragmatic_analyzer` function. The goal is to demonstrate how these two distinct pragmatic analysis tools can work together to provide a more comprehensive understanding of an utterance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Design: `pragmatic_analyzer(utterance: str)`\n",
    "The `pragmatic_analyzer` function will take a single string `utterance` as input and perform the following sequence of operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Speech Act Classification**: The input `utterance` will first be processed by the fine-tuned `DistilBertForSequenceClassification` model to predict its speech act (e.g., 'statement', 'question', 'directive'). This initial classification determines the primary communicative intent of the utterance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Conditional NLI Verification (for Statements)**: If the speech act classifier identifies the `utterance` as a 'statement', the function will proceed to perform NLI verification. For each fact in our predefined `knowledge_base`, the `nli_check` function will be invoked to determine the logical relationship (ENTAILMENT, CONTRADICTION, or NEUTRAL) between the statement and that fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Output Generation**: The function will return a structured output that includes:\n",
    "    *   The original `utterance`.\n",
    "    *   The predicted `speech_act`.\n",
    "    *   If the speech act is a 'statement', a list of NLI verification results, each containing the `fact`, `nli_prediction`, and potentially an explanation of the relationship.\n",
    "    *   If the speech act is not a 'statement', a clear indication that NLI verification was not performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This integrated approach allows us to first understand *what kind* of speech act is being performed and then, for statements, to verify their truthfulness or consistency against a given knowledge base. This forms the core of our pragmatic analysis system."

    "### Overview\n",
    "Following the setup of the NLI model and the `nli_check` function, this section focuses on evaluating its performance. While the demonstration with example pairs provided a qualitative sense, a more rigorous evaluation requires a set of test cases with known ground truth. This will allow us to quantify the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each NLI relationship (ENTAILMENT, CONTRADICTION, NEUTRAL).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "1.  **Manually Curated Test Set**: We will create a small, yet diverse, test set consisting of 20 `(statement, fact, gold_label)` tuples. Each tuple will represent a specific interaction between a statement (hypothesis) and a fact from our predefined `knowledge_base` (premise), along with a human-assigned 'gold label' indicating the true NLI relationship (ENTAILMENT, CONTRADICTION, or NEUTRAL).\n",
    "2.  **Prediction Generation**: For each pair in our test set, the `nli_check` function will be invoked to obtain the model's predicted NLI relationship.\n",
    "3.  **Performance Metrics**: The true (gold) labels and the model's predicted labels will be collected. We will then use `scikit-learn`'s `classification_report` to generate a comprehensive report of precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each NLI category. This report will offer detailed insights into where the model performs well and where it struggles. Special attention will be paid to `zero_division=0` to ensure the report handles cases where certain labels might not appear in predictions or true labels gracefully."

    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Even highly performant NLI models can exhibit errors, especially when dealing with nuanced language, world knowledge gaps, or complex logical structures. A thorough failure analysis is crucial to understand the limitations of the `roberta-large-mnli` model in our specific application and to identify areas for potential improvement or cautious interpretation of results. Visualization of these failures can provide quick, actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "1.  **Identify Inaccuracies**: Pinpoint specific instances where the NLI model fails to correctly identify the relationship between a statement and a fact (e.g., predicting 'NEUTRAL' instead of 'ENTAILMENT', or 'CONTRADICTION' instead of 'NEUTRAL').\n",
    "2.  **Categorize Error Types**: Group similar misclassifications to discern patterns. Common NLI error categories might include:\n",
    "    *   **Lexical Overlap Issues**: Model relies too heavily on shared words rather than meaning.\n",
    "    *   **World Knowledge Gaps**: Model lacks external information to correctly infer relationships.\n",
    "    *   **Negation/Antonym Errors**: Fails to correctly interpret negative statements or antonyms.\n",
    "    *   **Logical Reasoning Flaws**: Struggles with more complex inferential steps.\n",
    "    *   **Ambiguity**: Input statements or facts are inherently ambiguous, leading to varied interpretations.\n",
    "3.  **Inform Improvements**: The insights gained from failure analysis can guide strategies for improving the NLI component, such as refining the knowledge base, considering different NLI models, or adding pre-processing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "We will manually review the predictions from the `nli_check` function against our expected outcomes for the `example_statements` and `knowledge_base`. For each identified failure, we will record the statement, the fact, the predicted NLI label, and the *expected* NLI label, categorizing the type of error. Finally, we will visualize the distribution of these failure categories using a bar chart to highlight prevalent issues."

    "## Natural Language Inference (NLI) - Failure Analysis and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Even highly performant NLI models can exhibit errors, especially when dealing with nuanced language, world knowledge gaps, or complex logical structures. A thorough failure analysis is crucial to understand the limitations of the `roberta-large-mnli` model in our specific application and to identify areas for potential improvement or cautious interpretation of results. Visualization of these failures can provide quick, actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "1.  **Identify Inaccuracies**: Pinpoint specific instances where the NLI model fails to correctly identify the relationship between a statement and a fact (e.g., predicting 'NEUTRAL' instead of 'ENTAILMENT', or 'CONTRADICTION' instead of 'NEUTRAL').\n",
    "2.  **Categorize Error Types**: Group similar misclassifications to discern patterns. Common NLI error categories might include:\n",
    "    *   **Lexical Overlap Issues**: Model relies too heavily on shared words rather than meaning.\n",
    "    *   **World Knowledge Gaps**: Model lacks external information to correctly infer relationships.\n",
    "    *   **Negation/Antonym Errors**: Fails to correctly interpret negative statements or antonyms.\n",
    "    *   **Logical Reasoning Flaws**: Struggles with more complex inferential steps.\n",
    "    *   **Ambiguity**: Input statements or facts are inherently ambiguous, leading to varied interpretations.\n",
    "3.  **Inform Improvements**: The insights gained from failure analysis can guide strategies for improving the NLI component, such as refining the knowledge base, considering different NLI models, or adding pre-processing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "We will manually review the predictions from the `nli_check` function against our expected outcomes for the `example_statements` and `knowledge_base`. For each identified failure, we will record the statement, the fact, the predicted NLI label, and the *expected* NLI label, categorizing the type of error. Finally, we will visualize the distribution of these failure categories using a bar chart to highlight prevalent issues."

    "This section demonstrates the end-to-end functionality of the `pragmatic_analyzer` function, which integrates both the speech act classification and the Natural Language Inference (NLI) components. We will provide a variety of example utterances to observe how the system processes different types of speech acts and conditionally applies NLI verification for statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demonstration Plan\n",
    "1.  **Input Examples**: We will use a diverse set of example utterances, including:\n",
    "    *   Statements (e.g., factual claims, opinions).\n",
    "    *   Questions (e.g., direct questions, requests for information).\n",
    "    *   Directives (e.g., commands, requests).\n",
    "2.  **Speech Act Classification**: The `pragmatic_analyzer` will first classify each utterance into its respective speech act category.\n",
    "3.  **Conditional NLI Verification**: For utterances classified as 'statements', the analyzer will proceed to perform NLI verification against our predefined `knowledge_base`. For non-statements, NLI will be explicitly skipped.\n",
    "4.  **Output Analysis**: The results will be displayed in a clear format, showing the original utterance, its predicted speech act, and, if applicable, the NLI results for each fact in the knowledge base."

    "### Comprehensive Summary of Implementation\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the construction of an integrated pragmatic analyzer, combining a Speech Act Classifier with a Natural Language Inference (NLI) component. The process began with environmental setup, installing and importing necessary libraries. Due to persistent issues with loading the full Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus (SWDA), a dummy dataset was created for speech act classification, allowing for the demonstration of data preparation, fine-tuning of a `DistilBertForSequenceClassification` model, and subsequent evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NLI component was set up using a pre-trained `roberta-large-mnli` model and a small, manually curated knowledge base. A core `nli_check` function was developed to determine entailment, contradiction, or neutrality between statements and facts. Both the speech act classifier and the NLI component underwent individual evaluation and failure analysis to identify and categorize their limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, an integrated `pragmatic_analyzer` function was defined. This function first classifies the speech act of an utterance.

    "### Key Findings from Failure Analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Speech Act Classification Failure Analysis:**\n",
    "*   **Dummy Data Limitations:** The most significant finding was the limited generalizability of the speech act classifier due to the small, dummy dataset. With only 20 training and 10 testing examples and a simplified `statement`/`question` label space, the model showed high accuracy (90%) but struggled with nuanced classifications. For instance, a clear 'question' (`'Where is the nearest cafe?'`) was misclassified as a 'statement', highlighting the model's inability to capture subtle linguistic cues without sufficient training data.\n",
    "*   **Class Imbalance:** The dummy data implicitly created a severe class imbalance, with 'statement' being the predominant class, leading to a bias where the model often defaulted to 'statement' for uncertain inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NLI Failure Analysis:**\n",
    "*   **Context Sensitivity:** The NLI model, `roberta-large-mnli`, despite being powerful, exhibited challenges with context dependency and common-sense reasoning beyond its pre-trained scope. We observed instances where it predicted 'NEUTRAL' for clear 'ENTAILMENT' cases (e.g., `'Robins are birds.'` vs. `'Birds can fly.'`) or 'CONTRADICTION' for 'NEUTRAL' relationships (e.g., `'My car is fast.'` vs. `'Birds can fly.'`). This suggests that while it captures semantic relationships well, it can be sensitive to phrasing and may not always align with human intuition on subtle entailments or contradictions.\n",
    "*   **Lexical Overlap Bias:** The model sometimes seemed to rely on lexical overlap or lack thereof, leading to 'NEUTRAL' predictions when deeper semantic understanding was required, or 'CONTRADICTION' when sentences were simply unrelated but shared no conflicting terms.\n",
    "*   **Limited Knowledge Base Impact:** The small, static knowledge base significantly constrained the NLI component's utility, as it could only verify statements against a handful of facts. Many statements naturally fell into the 'NEUTRAL' category simply because no relevant facts existed in the knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges Encountered\n",
    "1.  **SWDA Dataset Loading:** The primary challenge was the inability to reliably load the real Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus (SWDA) from Hugging Face (`load_dataset('swda')`). This led to the necessary pivot to dummy data, which inevitably reduced the realism and robustness of the speech act classifier demonstration.\n",
    "2.  **Model Persistence & Reloading:** Ensuring model components (tokenizer, model, `id2label` mappings) were correctly passed or reloaded across different pipeline instantiations (especially for `text-classification` pipelines) required careful management, particularly when debugging issues related to label mapping in predictions.\n",
    "3.  **Colab Environment Limitations:** Resource constraints (RAM, GPU availability) in the Colab environment influenced batch sizes and the choice of models (e.g., using `DistilBERT` instead of larger models, CPU fallback for NLI).\n",
    "4.  **NLI Model Interpretation:** Interpreting the NLI model's predictions, especially for 'NEUTRAL' cases, highlighted the subjective nature of NLI for complex or highly nuanced relationships. Defining 'gold labels' for evaluation required careful human judgment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work\n",
    "1.  **Utilize Real Speech Act Data:** Overcoming the SWDA loading issues (or finding an alternative, robust real-world dataset) is paramount. This would enable training a much more accurate and generalizable speech act classifier.\n",
    "2.  **Expand and Refine NLI Knowledge Base:** Incorporating a larger, more domain-specific, and dynamically updateable knowledge base (e.g., using knowledge graphs or external APIs) would significantly enhance the NLI component's practical value.\n",
    "3.  **Improve Speech Act Granularity:** Once real data is available, refining the speech act categories beyond the simplified 'statement'/'question'/'directive' to cover more nuanced acts (e.g., 'apology', 'suggestion', 'agreement') would yield a more sophisticated pragmatic analysis.\n",
    "4.  **Dynamic NLI for Non-Statements:** Explore methods to apply NLI-like verification or contextual reasoning to non-statement speech acts (e.g., verifying if a 'request' is reasonable given context).\n",
    "5.  **Robust Model Saving and Loading:** Implement explicit saving and loading mechanisms for fine-tuned models to ensure reproducibility and ease of deployment.\n",

    "*   **Context Sensitivity:** The NLI model, `roberta-large-mnli`, despite being powerful, exhibited challenges with context dependency and common-sense reasoning beyond its pre-trained scope.

    "### Comprehensive Summary of Implementation\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the construction of an integrated pragmatic analyzer, combining a Speech Act Classifier with a Natural Language Inference (NLI) component. The process began with environmental setup, installing and importing necessary libraries. Due to persistent issues with loading the full Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus (SWDA), a dummy dataset was created for speech act classification, allowing for the demonstration of data preparation, fine-tuning of a `DistilBertForSequenceClassification` model, and subsequent evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NLI component was set up using a pre-trained `roberta-large-mnli` model and a small, manually curated knowledge base. A core `nli_check` function was developed to determine entailment, contradiction, or neutrality between statements and facts. Both the speech act classifier and the NLI component underwent individual evaluation and failure analysis to identify and categorize their limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, an integrated `pragmatic_analyzer` function was defined. This function first classifies the speech act of an utterance. If the utterance is identified as a 'statement', it then proceeds to verify its consistency against the knowledge base using the NLI model, providing a conditional, layered pragmatic analysis.\n",

    "### Key Findings from Failure Analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Speech Act Classification Failure Analysis:**\n",
    "*   **Dummy Data Limitations:** The most significant finding was the limited generalizability of the speech act classifier due to the small, dummy dataset. With only 20 training and 10 testing examples and a simplified `statement`/`question` label space, the model showed high accuracy (90%) but struggled with nuanced classifications. For instance, a clear 'question' (`'Where is the nearest cafe?'`) was misclassified as a 'statement', highlighting the model's inability to capture subtle linguistic cues without sufficient training data.\n",
    "*   **Class Imbalance:** The dummy data implicitly created a severe class imbalance, with 'statement' being the predominant class, leading to a bias where the model often defaulted to 'statement' for uncertain inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NLI Failure Analysis:**\n",
    "*   **Context Sensitivity:** The NLI model, `roberta-large-mnli`, despite being powerful, exhibited challenges with context dependency and common-sense reasoning beyond its pre-trained scope. We observed instances where it predicted 'NEUTRAL' for clear 'ENTAILMENT' cases (e.g., `'Robins are birds.'` vs. `'Birds can fly.'`) or 'CONTRADICTION' for 'NEUTRAL' relationships (e.g., `'My car is fast.'` vs. `'Birds can fly.'`). This suggests that while it captures semantic relationships well, it can be sensitive to phrasing and may not always align with human intuition on subtle entailments or contradictions.\n",
    "*   **Lexical Overlap Bias:** The model sometimes seemed to rely on lexical overlap or lack thereof, leading to 'NEUTRAL' predictions when deeper semantic understanding was required, or 'CONTRADICTION' when sentences were simply unrelated but shared no conflicting terms.\n",
    "*   **Limited Knowledge Base Impact:** The small, static knowledge base significantly constrained the NLI component's utility, as it could only verify statements against a handful of facts. Many statements naturally fell into the 'NEUTRAL' category simply because no relevant facts existed in the knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges Encountered\n",
    "1.  **SWDA Dataset Loading:** The primary challenge was the inability to reliably load the real Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus (SWDA) from Hugging Face (`load_dataset('swda')`). This led to the necessary pivot to dummy data, which inevitably reduced the realism and robustness of the speech act classifier demonstration.\n",
    "2.  **Model Persistence & Reloading:** Ensuring model components (tokenizer, model, `id2label` mappings) were correctly passed or reloaded across different pipeline instantiations (especially for `text-classification` pipelines) required careful management, particularly when debugging issues related to label mapping in predictions.\n",
    "3.  **Colab Environment Limitations:** Resource constraints (RAM, GPU availability) in the Colab environment influenced batch sizes and the choice of models (e.g., using `DistilBERT` instead of larger models, CPU fallback for NLI).\n",
    "4.  **NLI Model Interpretation:** Interpreting the NLI model's predictions, especially for 'NEUTRAL' cases, highlighted the subjective nature of NLI for complex or highly nuanced relationships. Defining 'gold labels' for evaluation required careful human judgment.\n",

    "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Speech Act Classifier Performance:** The speech act classifier, trained on a small dummy dataset (20 training, 10 testing examples) with simplified labels, achieved 90% accuracy. However, it misclassified a clear 'question' as a 'statement', highlighting poor generalizability and a bias towards 'statement' due to class imbalance. In the integrated analyzer, *all* example utterances (including intended questions and directives) were consistently misclassified as 'statement'.\n",
    "*   **NLI Model Performance (Evaluation Set):**\n",
    "    *   On a small test set of 20 manually curated pairs, the NLI model achieved an overall accuracy of 65% and a macro average F1-score of 0.66.\n",
    "    *   It performed well in identifying 'ENTAILMENT' (1.00 precision), but missed some true entailment cases (0.67 recall).\n",
    "    *   It exhibited high recall (1.00) for 'CONTRADICTION' but lower precision (0.55), indicating false positives.\n",
    "    *   Performance for 'NEUTRAL' relationships was notably weaker (0.38 recall), suggesting difficulty in identifying neutral relationships.\n",
    "*   **NLI Failure Analysis (Example and Test Sets):**\n",
    "    *   Initial analysis with example statements against a simple knowledge base identified 24 misclassifications, with \"False Contradiction (Predicted Contradiction)\" being the most frequent (18 instances).\n",
    "    *   Failure analysis on the 20-pair test set revealed 7 misclassifications. The most common errors were \"False Contradiction (Predicted Contradiction)\" (5 instances, e.g., predicting CONTRADICTION for unrelated statements) and \"Missed Entailment (Predicted Neutral)\" (2 instances, e.g., predicting NEUTRAL for \"Robins are birds.\" vs. \"Birds can fly.\").\n",
    "*   **NLI Model Limitations:** The `roberta-large-mnli` model showed challenges with context dependency, common-sense reasoning, and a tendency to be influenced by lexical overlap. It often struggled to align with human intuition for subtle entailments or contradictions.\n",
    "*   **Integrated Analyzer Behavior:** The `pragmatic_analyzer` successfully integrates the speech act classification and NLI components. However, due to the speech act classifier's limitations, NLI verification was often performed universally, even for utterances intended as questions or directives, rather than conditionally as designed.\n",
    "*   **Knowledge Base Impact:** The small, static knowledge base significantly limited the NLI component's practical utility, as many statements were deemed 'NEUTRAL' simply due to a lack of relevant facts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Improve Speech Act Classifier Data & Model:** Address the inability to load the real Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus (SWDA) or use a larger, more diverse dataset. This is crucial for training a robust speech act classifier that can accurately distinguish between different speech acts, enabling proper conditional NLI verification.\n",
    "*   **Enhance NLI Knowledge Base:** Develop a larger, more dynamic, and domain-specific knowledge base to improve the NLI component's ability to verify statements against a broader and more relevant set of facts, moving beyond simple lexical overlap.\n"
